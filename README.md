# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Linux. Includes custom configuration for:

* Atom
* Bash
* Compton
* Dunst
* Firefox
* Fish
* flashfocus
* Fonts
* GTK
* i3
* kitty
* Mousepad
* Polybar
* Redshift
* Rofi
* Vim
* VLC
* X
* zsh

## Installation

The dotfiles are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so installation and management is simple!

### Download

`git clone https://github.com/adamrutter/dotfiles.git`

### Install a specific configuration

Change to the dotfiles directory, and:

`stow atom`

### Install everything

Change to the dotfiles directory, and:

`stow *`

## Notes

### Accent colour

The accent colour is kept uniform across all programs. This requires editing:

* The GTK theme (see [here](#gtk))
* The `*accent` variable in `x/.Xresources`
* The `--accent-color` variable in `firefox/.mozilla/firefox/$YOUR_PROFILE/chrome/userChrome.css`
* The `@accent` variable in `atom/.atom/styles.less` for Atom
* The `@accent-color` variable in `atom/.atom/packages/my-one-dark-ui/styles/ui-variables-custom.less`
* The custom zsh prompt in `zsh/.oh-my-zsh/themes/adamrutter.zsh-theme`
* The custom fish prompt in `fish/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`
* The custom bash prompt in `bash/.bashrc`
* `frame_color` and `separator_color` in `dunst/.config/dunst/dunstrc` (Note: edit the one under the `[global]` heading, not under `[urgency_critical]`)
* The icon colour (see [here](#gtk))
* `highlight-selected` in `rofi/.config/rofi/config.rasi`

This is probably something I will automate in future with a script.

### GTK

A custom theme is used, generated by [oomox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox).

### Polybar

My Polybar shows a system monitor on the left, workspace indicators in the middle, and a weather indicator, volume control, and clock to the right.

The system tray also contains an indicator that reports things about my phone. It tells me battery information and whether the filesystem of the phone is currently mounted (I wrote a script that automatically mounts the filesystem using [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) when my phone is on the home network, and it is useful to be able to see the status at a glance).
