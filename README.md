# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Linux.

## Installation

The dotfiles are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so installation and management is simple!

### Download

`git clone https://github.com/adamrutter/dotfiles.git`

### Install a specific configuration

Change to the dotfiles directory, and:

`stow awesome`
