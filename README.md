# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Linux.

## Installation

The dotfiles are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so installation and management is simple!

### Download

`git clone https://github.com/adamrutter/dotfiles.git`

### Install a specific configuration

Change to the dotfiles directory, and:

`stow awesome`

## Notes

### GTK

A custom variant of [Arc](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) is used. Checkout [my Arc repo](https://github.com/adamrutter/arc-theme) for the script I use to build Arc variants.
